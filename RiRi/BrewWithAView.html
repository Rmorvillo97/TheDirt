  <p>Picked up this fitting beer for a sunny afternoon on Giantâ€™s Nubble. view: 9/10 spectacular views of the great range, the dix range and giant. I also really enjoyed the broad summit on this lookout. I will definitely be returning here during peak foliage. brew: 7/10 wheat ales are my fav and this one did the trick!

  <p>Couldnâ€™t take too long of a break from hiking so yesterday after work I ventured to Owlâ€™s Head Lookout.
  view: 8/10 partially wooded summit with an interesting view of the back sides of Green, Giant and Rocky Peak Ridge. Also a glimpse of my favorite mountain, Hurricane, from the top too!
  brew: 10/10 Switchback ale can do no wrong in my eyes. 
  Highly encourage this hike if youâ€™re looking for something quiet and scenic that wonâ€™t wear you out too much.

  <p> I reallllly dug this hike. and this beer. an overall fantastic combo. 
view: 10/10 bear den mountain!! unique views of Whiteface, the Sentinel Range and the MacIntyre Range waaaaay off in the distance. I also had the summit to myself which was a nice cap to the hike ðŸ˜Œ
brew: 9/10 super smooth pilsner with a crisp finish.

  <p>Letâ€™s talk about Leave No Trace ethics for a hot second. I have decided to no longer geotag the specific mountain I am on in order to promote responsible land use and discourage the overuse of trails. that being said, if you are DYING to know what view this is (or any in the future), I will happily share through a direct message :) now letâ€™s get to it!
  view: 10/10 unique views all around the summit and an abundance of lookout points which I always appreciate
  brew: 9/10 Paradox has been a favorite brewery of mine for a lil while now and although I think their Pilsner is hoppy, it has surely grown on me as I am beginning to enjoy that taste more!
  BWAV Bonus: If you can name any of the high peaks from this view I will give you a firm handshake.

  <p>This would have been a much better experience if ya girl hadnâ€™t forgotten her bug spray during black fly season...nevertheless I was in awe of not only the summit of Van Hoe, but the picturesque beaver meadow that the trail snaked along as well. brew was a little hoppier than expected, but did alright for a casual sip. 
Brew: 6/10
View: 10/10
